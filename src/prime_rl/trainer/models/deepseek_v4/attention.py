[DeepSeek V4 Attention Layers]

The attention layers in this architecture generally begin with a few sliding-window attention layers
(just the first two layers in V4 Flash) followed by interleaved complex compressed attention
variants involving either Compressed Sparse Attention (CSA) or Heavily Compressed Attention (HCA).
CSA compresses with a smaller window (~4 toks) and adds additional sparsity on top via a "Lightning
Indexer", while HCA uses a more aggressive window (~128 toks) with no additional sparsity. A sketch
of the compressed variants is below, tensors flowing downwards:

[Packing Details]

We describe our abstractions and nomenclature for DeepSeek V4 packed sequences below, which are
useful due to the complexities introduced by the compressed attention variants. Ultimately, all
necessary attention data is organized into a `PackedContext` object (directly consumed by attention
layers), built from one `seq_lens` and carrying:

  - `position_ids`: each token's position within its own document.
  - `tok_doc_idx`: which document each token belongs to.
  - `window_indices`: for each query, the indices of the tokens its local window covers, causal
    and clipped at document boundaries, with `IGNORE_SLOT` (-1) marking invalid/masked entries.
  - `compression_layouts`: one `CompressionLayout` per compress rate in the architecture.

The last of those characterizes the token-compression mechanism of DeepSeek V4. We start with it
below.

We pack several documents end to end in a flat token stream. Each compressed attention variant
defines a `compress_rate`: that variant compresses each group of `compress_rate` consecutive tokens
into an individual `entry`. For packed sequence and each `compress_rate` in the architecture, we
build one `CompressionLayout` object whose responsibility is to handle the document-aware bookkeeping
for such packed-document compression.

Take the following illustrative example of two packed documents and `compress_rate = 4`:

  token             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 │   9 10 11 12 13
                  └───────── doc 0 ─────────┘   └─── doc 1 ───┘
  entry           └─── e0 ───┘└─── e1 ───┘  x   └─── e2 ───┘  x

We've indicated which tokens get pooled into which entries (tokens marked `x` belong to no entry) .
A complete, generic description of the packed and compressed state requires four pieces of data:

  - Which tokens belong to which entries: `entry_tok_idx`.
  - Which document each entry belongs to (for causality): `entry_doc_idx`.
  - Where an entry sits within its own document (useful for RoPE + causality): `entry_local_idx`.
  - Which document each token belongs to (causality, again): `tok_doc_idx`.

For the above example:

  token             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 │   9 10 11 12 13
                  └───────── doc 0 ─────────┘   └─── doc 1 ───┘
  entry           └─── e0 ───┘└─── e1 ───┘  x   └─── e2 ───┘  x

  entry_tok_idx    [0  1  2  3][4  5  6  7]      [9 10 11 12]
  entry_doc_idx        0           0                 1
  entry_local_idx      0           1                 0
  tok_doc_idx       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0     1  1  1  1  1

The first three depend on the compress rate and are stored on the `CompressionLayout` abstraction
used below. The fourth does not: `tok_doc_idx` describes the token stream alone, so `PackedContext`
holds it once and shares it across rates.

Compression is only part of the story: every attention layer also reads a local sliding window of
the most recent tokens directly, and the compressed entries are how it reaches anything older.
That window is enumerated per document by `window_indices`, and every rotation in the block needs
`position_ids`. Neither belongs to any single compress rate.

`PackedContext.build` takes `seq_lens` and derives every one of its fields from it. Nothing else is
an input, so a position that disagrees with a document boundary or a window slot that spans one
cannot be constructed. It runs once per model forward.

Context parallelism splits the queries across ranks and leaves everything else alone: every field
above has one entry per query token and so covers this rank's `n_queries` tokens, while
`compression_layouts` covers all `total_tokens` of the sequence. Token indices always count from
the start of the whole sequence.

[The Index Contract]

All three layer types reach their keys the same way. `SparseAttnInputs` lays out one KV buffer,

    kv_buf[b, n, 0, d]:  the packed token stream, then this layer's compressed entries, and
                         nothing else: an absent key needs no position of its own

and one int32 index tensor addressing that position axis, `sliding_window + picks` slots per
query: the local window first, the picks after. `picks` is the indexer's `index_topk` for CSA,
`max_entries_per_doc` for HCA, and zero for a sliding layer, which reads its window alone. A slot
with nothing to read holds `IGNORE_SLOT` (-1), which the kernel masks on, so a short window and a
surplus pick cost only their loads.

    `kv` and `gate` are this compressor's own projections of the hidden state, gathered at the
    source tokens of entry `e`'s pooling window, and `d` runs over `head_dim`. Each entry is
    RMSNormed and rotated with the `compress` RoPE at its window's first source position, which
    is what makes it comparable with the attention block's locally rotated KV stream. `forward`
    returns the entries alongside this layer's entry selection: the per-query entry indices the
    attention block gathers, with `IGNORE_SLOT` (-1) marking a slot the query has nothing to read into.

    `n_series` sets the slots `s` the gate ranges over. With `1` a token joins only its own
    window, so windows are disjoint. With `2` the projections emit two `head_dim`-wide series
    `Ca` and `Cb`, and entry `e` pools `Ca` from entry `e - 1`'s tokens together with `Cb` from
    its own, so windows overlap at stride `compress_rate`; a document's first entry has no
