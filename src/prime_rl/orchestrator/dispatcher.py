"""Dispatcher: schedules rollouts under a shared permit counter.

- Capacity (``max_inflight``) is shared across train + eval. One permit is
  one episode: one ``run`` request against an env server. The cap is dynamic —
  the concurrency controller moves it via ``set_limit``; refills are
  burst-capped so a raised (or drained) cap never lands all its prefills at
  once.
- Optional rate limiting via ``AsyncLimiter(tasks_per_minute, 60)``.
- Every dispatched attempt reaches ``out_q`` exactly once: as the native
  episode returned by the environment, as a ``DispatchFailure`` when no
  episode was produced, or under the group's ``GroupCancellation`` when the
  orchestrator abandons it.
- ``DispatcherMode.PREFER_TRAIN`` / ``PREFER_EVAL`` controls which kind to
  schedule next. Transitions are level-triggered (driven by the eval
  source's emptiness), so in-flight episodes of the opposite kind drain
  naturally on either side of an eval boundary.
- ``on_version_pending`` (called by the watcher before the engines pause for
  the weight update) drops train groups already past ``max_off_policy_steps`` — a
  compute-saving early cancel; the sink's queue sweep is what guarantees the
  bound. Eval episodes are measurements for the policy version they started
  with. Online evals may explicitly cancel them when a newer checkpoint is ready. Train
  episodes sampled from a frozen model never go stale — their generation
  source doesn't change with policy updates.
