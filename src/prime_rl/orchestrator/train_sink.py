"""Training-side episode, group, and batch assembly.

``add()`` takes one completed episode, ``fail()`` a request that produced no
episode, and ``cancel()`` a dropped group's ``GroupCancellation``. Before every
readiness check the sink sweeps ``pending_batch`` for traces past
``max_off_policy_steps`` — this sweep, not the dispatcher's in-flight cancel,
is what guarantees nothing stale ships."""
