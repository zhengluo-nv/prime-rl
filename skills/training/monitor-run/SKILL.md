# Monitor a run

## Runbook

### On launch

1. Find the run dir and read the resolved configs at `{run_dir}/configs/latest/resolved/` (start with `rl.json`, or `orchestrator.json` on local runs). Read the launch command from `{run_dir}/configs/latest/command.txt`. The launch TOML is copied verbatim to `{run_dir}/configs/latest/rl.toml`. The run dir is `{output_dir}/{run_name}` — `run.name` auto-generates as `<envs>--<model>--<short-id>`, so if you only know the output dir, pick the most recently modified subdirectory (`ls -t {output_dir} | head -1`) or read `run.name` from the launch command.
2. Confirm all processes are alive and the run is making progress.
3. Write the initial summary into `{run_dir}/STATUS.md`.

### Recurring check-ins

Default cadence: **1 hour** (researcher can override). At each check-in:

1. Confirm processes are alive.
2. Grep logs for errors/warnings; note current step and key metrics.
3. **Append** an entry to `{run_dir}/STATUS.md` (never overwrite):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC

**Step**: {current_step} / {max_steps}
**Health**: {Healthy | Degraded | Down}

**Progress**: reward/mean, seq_len, truncation, eval scores, env-specific metrics.
**Stability**: entropy, mismatch_kl, grad_norm — flag spikes.
**Performance**: trainer vs orchestrator step time, env lag, inference pressure.

**Notes**: anything unusual (errors, restarts, hangs). Omit if nothing notable.
```

In W&B, each project auto-gets an **"overview" saved view** (train / eval / stability / performance sections) on its first run — use it for a quick check instead of the auto-generated default workspace.

### Restarting a run

**Never restart unless the researcher explicitly asked.** Confirm the exact restart command and the conditions that warrant one.

**Never** run kill or launch commands yourself. Hand the researcher the exact command and let them run it; after a restart, verify all processes are back up and progress resumed before the next check-in.

## Reference

### Where to find things

- `{run_dir}/configs/latest/` — the current attempt's command, launch TOML, and `resolved/` JSON files. Each launch stays under `configs/attempt_<n>/`.
- `{run_dir}/logs/latest/` — the current attempt's logs (each launch gets `logs/attempt_<n>/`; resumes never overwrite earlier attempts). See below.
- `{run_dir}/monitors/file/` — the metrics, and the traces with the annotations about them (see Episodes below).

### Dashboard

`uv run dashboard [output_dir ...]` (default `outputs/`, or `$PRL_OUTPUT_DIR` if set; several dirs can be tracked at
once) serves a local web dashboard at `http://localhost:7788` with four views per run:
metrics (the W&B overview sections, read from `metrics.jsonl`), per-attempt config
files, a rollout trace viewer with per-token overlays (advantage, trainer logprob,
entropy, KL mismatch, stable/loss/content masks), and merged component logs. It only reads the run dirs — safe to run against a live run.
`--port`/`--host` pick the bind address; a taken port automatically bumps to the next
free one, so several dashboards run side by side without coordination. GPU deps live
behind the `gpu` extra, so `uv sync --extra dashboard && uv run dashboard` works
without the training stack (e.g. on a head node).

**Daemon (auto-start)**: launchers auto-start one dashboard per host per user and a
live one absorbs each new run's output dir automatically — see the `dashboard` skill
for discovery, kill/restart commands, and `--isolated`. The short version: the live
port can differ from 7788 (a taken port bumps), so read the discovery file:

```bash
cat ~/.cache/prime-rl/dashboard/daemon.json   # {"pid": ..., "url": "http://localhost:<actual port>"}
ps aux | grep PRL::Dashboard                  # the daemon's process title
```

Verify liveness with `curl -sf <url>/api/runs` and hand the researcher the `url`.

### Logs

```

SLURM batch logs are under `{run_dir}/launcher/logs/*job_*.log`.

Usually tailing `trainer.log`, `orchestrator.log`, and `inference.log` is enough. Drop into per-node or per-rank logs only when debugging. All logs are loguru with `HH:mm:ss  LEVEL  message`; levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `SUCCESS`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.

Scan for problems:

```bash
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {run_dir}/logs/latest/{trainer,orchestrator,eval,inference}.log
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {run_dir}/logs/latest/envs/{train,eval}/*.log
```

### Live rollouts

`{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/live/<trace_id>.jsonl` holds the env server's streamed deltas of one live rollout (train or eval) and disappears when its episode lands in the stream, so the directory is the live set. `uv run python -m prime_rl.monitors.file.traces {run_dir}` prints one row per live trace with `stage` (pending/boot/setup/running/finalize/scoring/done/error), turns, tokens, elapsed and the latest message; with a trace id it prints the assembled trace. The dashboard's traces tab shows them in the episode table (tinted, phase badge, growing counts; filter status → in flight) and opens them in the viewer.

### Metrics

All metrics print to the console log (and W&B when configured).

**Progress** — orchestrator log. Rollout metrics mirror the episode/trace hierarchy, at two levels:

- `{scope}/{subset}/<metric>/<stat>` — episode-level facts only: the token/turn/branch counts, summed over an episode's traces.
- `{scope}/{subset}/<agent>/<metric>/<stat>` — every trace-level metric (reward, truncation, errors, timing, env metrics, eval scores), keyed by agent name so seats never mix. Flat over that agent's traces: one sample is one trace, so an in-episode fan-out like n solvers contributes n samples.

`scope` is `train/agg` (all train envs) or `train/<env>` (`eval/<env>` for eval); `subset` is `all` (every rollout) or `effective` (sampled into a batch, clean, and trainable). Single-agent envs have one agent — usually `agent` — and one trace per episode, so both levels agree; multi-agent envs name each seat (`proposer`, `solver`, `judge`, …).

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `train/agg/effective/<agent>/reward/mean` | mean training reward for that agent (per env: `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/reward/mean`) |
| `train/agg/effective/num_total_tokens/mean` | avg tokens per episode, summed over its agents (also `num_input_tokens`, `num_output_tokens`) |
| `train/agg/effective/num_turns/mean` | avg turns per episode, summed over its agents |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/num_turns/mean` | avg turns for that agent alone (also token counts, `num_branches`) |
| `train/agg/effective/<agent>/is_truncated/mean` | fraction of that agent's rollouts truncated |
| `train/agg/all/<agent>/has_error/mean` | fraction of that agent's rollouts errored (per-type under `train/agg/all/<agent>/error/<type>`; also `dispatcher/errored/{train,eval}`) |
| `train/agg/all/<agent>/is_trainable/mean` | fraction carrying a training signal — 0.0 for a frozen seat like a judge |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/metrics/<name>/mean` | env-specific metrics for that agent (e.g. pass rate) |
| `train/<env>/effective/<agent>/timing/agent/model/mean` | model vs harness share of that agent's phase |
| `eval/<env>/effective/<agent>/{avg@k,pass@k}` | eval scores for that agent, when configured |

**Stability** — trainer log:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mismatch_kl/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | KL between trainer and (old) inference policy over trainable tokens |
| `entropy/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | policy entropy over trainable tokens |
| `is_masked/mean` | fraction of tokens masked by the IPO trust region |
| `optim/grad_norm` | spikes may precede divergence |

**Performance** — trainer and orchestrator step independently, so comparing step times shows who's waiting on whom.

| Source | Metric | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| trainer | `time/step` | total trainer step |
| trainer | `time/wait_for_batch` | **high → orchestrator is bottleneck** |
| trainer | `time/forward_backward`, `time/broadcast_weights`, `time/save_ckpt` | phase timings |
| trainer | `perf/throughput`, `perf/mfu` | tokens/s and MFU % |
| orchestrator | `time/step`, `time/save_ckpt` | phase timings |
| orchestrator | `time/wait_for_policy` | **high → trainer is bottleneck** |
| orchestrator | `dispatcher/off_policy/{mean,max}`, `dispatcher/inflight/{train,eval}`, `dispatcher/queued/eval` | dispatcher / async state |
| orchestrator | `off_policy/{mean,max}`, `off_policy/{in_flight,in_queue}/{mean,max}`, `off_policy/dropped` | per-step staleness of trained rollouts |
| env server | event loop lag (min/mean/p90/p99/max), active task distribution | periodic |

The trainer warns when batch wait time exceeds active trainer time. Add inference nodes when this warning persists. The orchestrator warns when policy wait time exceeds active orchestrator time. Add trainer nodes when this warning persists. The orchestrator also warns when it discards more than half of an episode window and reports stale, errored, and no-signal counts.

`orchestrator.constant_trainer_batch_size` defaults to `true`. It keeps each rollout batch at `orchestrator.batch_size` effective episodes. Set it to `false` for faster collection with variable trainer batch sizes.

For live vLLM stats, query Prometheus directly:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8100/metrics | grep -E "num_requests|gpu_cache_usage"  # engine port (8000 is the router)
# vllm:num_requests_running, vllm:num_requests_waiting, vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc (→1.0 = KV cache saturated)
```

### Episodes

```
{run_dir}/monitors/file/metrics.jsonl                              # every metric row, tagged by producer
{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream/00000.jsonl.zst              # every episode, appended as it arrives: sealed chunks ...
{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream/00001.jsonl                  # ... and the live one, plain text
{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream.index.jsonl                  # one compact row per episode, with its chunk and byte offset
{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/annotations/{producer}/00000.jsonl  # trace updates: orch ship-time facts, trainer per-token streams
{run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/annotations/{producer}.index.jsonl  # each update's scalars and where its record sits
```

Everything the file monitor dumps lives under `monitors/file/`; nothing is written
there when the monitor is off. The traces and everything written about them sit under
`traces/`. Each stream is a directory of numbered chunks — the writer rolls to a new
chunk at `monitors.file.chunk_bytes` (5 GiB) and, with `monitors.file.compress` (on),
seals the full one with zstd in the background; a finished run seals its live chunk
too. Sealed chunks use seekable frames, so a seek still costs one frame, and
`zstd -dcf` streams them together with the plain live chunk. Every index is named for
the stream it indexes and sits beside it. Those indexes are what keep reading a run
cheap: a consumer browses them instead of the streams, and seeks by the chunk and
offset they carry to read a single episode or its token streams. Both are derived, so
deleting them only costs a reader the work of rebuilding what it needs. The stream
holds native `vf.Episode` records (training tensors excluded; per-token floats rounded
to `monitors.file.float_decimals`, 4 by default), one line per episode in arrival order, whatever kind of work it did —
including trace-less failures and work that never enters a
batch, so it is crash-durable. Each record carries its provenance: `env` (`id` plus the
orchestrator's `name`), full `task`, `group` (`id`), and `run`.

A trace has several steps, so each is stamped as its own event rather than implied by
where the record sits. The file monitor stamps `info.kind` and `info.dispatch`/
`info.arrival` (`{step, time}` each) as an episode lands; the ship-time annotation adds
`info.effective` and `info.ship` — the orchestrator step whose batch shipped the
cohort, or for eval the step that produced the policy it measured. Staleness is
`ship.step - dispatch.step`. Only `effective` ties to a step; `all` is the whole stream.

Everything learned after arrival is an append-only trace update keyed by `trace_id`,
one file per producer so each has a single writer: the orchestrator records cohort
membership, the scalar advantage and per-branch advantage streams; the trainer records
its recomputed per-token logprobs and entropies. Readers fold the updates onto the
stream records, newest winning.

```bash
wc -l {run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream.index.jsonl
zstd -dcf {run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream/* | jq '.traces[].rewards'
zstd -dcf {run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/stream/* | jq 'select(.ok | not) | {id, env: .env.id, errors}'
jq '{trace_id, info}' {run_dir}/monitors/file/traces/annotations/orch.index.jsonl
```

The batches consumed by the trainer are shipped over ZMQ by default, so nothing binary is written. With `rollout_transport.type = "filesystem"` they land at `{run_dir}/batches/step_{n}/rank_<rank>.bin` (one packed micro-batch file per trainer DP rank).

### Common failure modes

A few warnings are normal. Escalate when errors are persistent, growing, or hit a large fraction of rollouts.

- **Env workers**: exceptions in env code, timeouts, sandbox errors, OOM kills (most common source — runs user code).
- **Orchestrator**: empty/errored rollout spikes, weight-broadcast failures, checkpoint errors.
- **Trainer**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, NaN loss or gradients.
- **Inference**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, request timeouts.

### Process tree

All processes use `setproctitle` so they're visible in `ps`/`htop`/`pstree`:

```
PRL::Launcher
├── PRL::Inference          (vLLM server, GPU 0)
├── PRL::EnvServer          (verifiers' ZMQ env server, run in-process; one per train/eval source)
│   └── Verifiers::EnvWorker0..N
├── PRL::Orchestrator       (CPU-only; connects to each env server)
├── torchrun
│   └── PRL::Trainer        (GPU 1+)
└── tail trainer.log
```

For multi-node runs, trainer and inference processes are on separate nodes — use `srun` or `ssh` to inspect them.
